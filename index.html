        <h1>Emily Fernan</h1>
        <p><em>Learner web developer.</em></p>
        <p>After having been an English teacher for over 7 years, I'm convinced that maintaining structure and being organised make for success in and outside of the classroom. Compassion and empathy are two skills that I deem necessary during all
          communications. Advising and coaching people on making the best choices in numerous contexts is what I excel at.
          Plus: I can always make my colleagues smile with my baking and my laughter and humour.
          Skills: coaching, advising, effective communication, sales, writing, project planning and coordinating, team leadership, people development, language teaching, translation, curriculum development, baking.</p>
